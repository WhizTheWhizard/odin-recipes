    <h2>Description</h2>
    <div>
        <p>A homemade Smash Burger is quick and easy to make. These fly off the grill in minutes so it's a great way to feed a crowd.
            Smash burgers have the iconic flavor profile of classic Burgers, but that double burger patty with cheese melted in between 
            is irresistible and you'll love the special sauce.</p>
        <p>Smash burgers are formed into balls of ground beef then pressed or smashed with a burger press into a thin patty as soon as they hit the grill. 
            This creates extra browning and flavor on the outside while maintaining the patty's juiciness.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground Beef</li>
        <li>Sauce</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Buns</li>
        <li>Lettuce</li>
        <li>Pickles</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Red Onion</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare Patties</strong> - Divide 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef into 8 equal portions (3 oz each), cover, and refrigerate until ready to cook.</li>
        <li><strong>Make Sauce</strong> - Stir together 1/3 cup mayo and 1 tsp mustard and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Prep Toppings</strong> - fully prep your toppings ahead to assemble the burgers right away while the patties are hot and juicy off the grill.</li>
        <li><strong>Toast Buns</strong> - lightly butter the cut side of your buns and toast on a griddle or skillet over medium heat until golden brown. 
            Transfer to a rack.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook Patties</strong> - increase to medium-high heat. Depending on your surface area, place 2 to 4 cold pieces of meat onto the hot surface. 
            Working quickly, cover each piece with a sheet of parchment paper and smash each into a thin patty. Remove parchment paper, season with salt, pepper, 
            and garlic powder, add a dab of sauce, and flip. Sear for 2 minutes on the first side and about a minute on the second side.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Cheese</strong> - place a slice of cheese onto half of the patties and top with a second patty and remove from heat. Serve warm over toasted buns with toppings.
        </li>
