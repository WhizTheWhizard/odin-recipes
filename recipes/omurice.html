    <h2>Description</h2>
    <div>
        <p>Japanese omurice (オムライス) is a thin, soft-cooked omelette wrapped around seasoned Japanese ketchup rice (ケチャップライス) or chicken rice (チキンライス). 
            The name itself is a catchy Japanese loanword that blends “omelette” and “rice.”</p>
        <p>This Western-style dish is unique to Japan, as it doesn't exist in American or European cuisine. Several restaurants in Japan claim to have created omurice 
            in the early 1900s. However, it was in 1925 that a chef in Osaka at a Western-style diner called Hokkyokusei created a dish very similar to the omurice that 
            we know and love today.</p>
