    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Another Food Wars inspired recipe! Soma, the main character, needed to come up with a fried chicken recipe that would bring business back to his neighborhood.
        Since this is a cooking show, he ca't just serve any old regular fried chicken. Instead, he came up with this fun wrap you can eat on the go!</p>
    <p>This wrap isn't a standard crepe or pita, it's made of bahn xeo. Chef K and I have made bahn xeo before. It's one of my mom's favorite Vietnamese dishes and 
        it's surprisingly really easy to make. The rice flour batter gives bahn xeo a nice crisp that is perfect with the fried chicken.</p>
   
   
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3>Fried Chicken</h3>
        <li>1 lb chicken thigh</li>
        <li>3 tbsp tamari</li>
        <li>1 tbsp mirin</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ginger</li>
        <li>1/2 sweet apple</li>
        <li>1/4 yellow onion</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp gochugaru</li>
        <li>1 cup potato starch</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <h3>Sauce</h3>
        <li>1/4 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>2 tsp gochujang</li>
        <li>1 tbsp fish sauce</li>
        <h3>Toppings</h3>
        <li>red romaine lettuce</li>
        <li>basil</li>
        <li>mint</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add all marinade ingredients except for the chicken, starch, and cooking spray into a food processor. Pulse a few times until the apple and onions are broken down. 
            It does not have to be a smooth paste, since it's just a marinade.</li>
        <li>Place chicken in a ziploc bag with the marinade and set in the refrigerator for 2 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Heat up the air fryer to 360 degrees F. Remove chicken from the marinade and coat in starch. Spray the insert with oil, add the chicken in batches (do not overfill), 
            and air fry for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk together all sauce ingredients.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
        
    </ol>
